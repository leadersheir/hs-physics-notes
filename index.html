      <h4>Intermolecular Forces</h4>
      The forces that act between molecules are, obviously enough, called <em>intermolecular</em> forces. They arise from
      <ol>
        <li>Potential energy from the iteraction with surrounding molecules.</li>
        <li>Thermal energy from the movement of the system of molecules. This is essentially kinetic energy.</li>
      </ol>

      Intermolecular forces between two molecules primarily depend on the distance \(r\) between them.

      <h4>Types of Bonds</h4>
      Each of the points in the uniform lattice structure which certain substances assume when forming a bond is called a <em>lattice point</em>.

      <h5>Ionic Bonds</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Each of the lattice points is occupied by an ion.</li>
        <li>Attraction arises from the electrostatic force; which being strong, also makes the bonds comparatively strong.</li>
        <li>The melting point is high due to the strength of the bonds.</li>
        <li>The electro-conductivity is low.</li>
        <li>Ionic bonds are only established between a metal and a non-metal.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Covalent Bonds</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>It's established only between non-metals by the sharing of electrons between two adjacent atoms.</li>
        <li>Highly rigid.</li>
        <li>High melting point.</li>
        <li>Low electro-conductivity.</li>
        <li>Compounds formed by covalent bonds generally act as electric dipoles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Metallic Bonds</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Established due to the presence of delocalized electrons, essentially like sharing the electrons of a metal atom with the rest of the atoms in a solid body.</li>
        <li>The lattice points have positive ions and free electrons move around the whole structure.</li>
        <li>High electro-conductivity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Vandar Waals Bond</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Arises between nonpolar molecules due to a temporary change in dipole moment.</li>
        <li>Solids formed by this bond are called <em>molecular solids</em>.</li>
        <li>Solids formed by this bond are generally soft.</li>
        <li>Low melting point and bad electro-conductivity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Definitions Regarding Elasticity</h4>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Elasticity</strong>. The property of a deformed material to regain its original length, volume, and shape, once the deforming force has been removed, is called <em>elasticity</em>. <br><br>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Perfectly Elastic Body</strong>. A deformed body that fully returns to its initial length, volume, and shape, once the deforming force has been removed, is called a <em>perfectly elastic body</em>. <br><br>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Elastic Limit</strong>. The maximum applied force up to which a body remains <em>perfectly elastic</em> is called the <em>elastic limit</em>. <br><br>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Perfectly Rigid Body</strong>. A body that cannot be deformed by applying any magnitude of external force is called a <em>perfectly rigid body</em>. Such substances are not observed in nature. <br><br>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Perfectly Plastic Body</strong>. A body that retains its deformed shape and size once the deforming force has been removed, is called a <em>perfectly plastic body</em>. <br><br>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Breaking Force</strong>. The minimum applied force for which a body breaks or snaps is called the <em>breaking force</em>. <br><br>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Breaking Stress</strong>. The minimum perpendicular force applied per unit area for which a body breaks or snaps is called the <em>breaking stress</em>. <br><br>

      <h4>Elastic Properties</h4>

      <strong>Strain</strong> is the <em>change in the dimensions per unit dimension of a body due to the application of an external force</em>. It's the rate of deformation of a body.
      \[
        \text{strain} = \frac{B \text{~} A}{A}
      \]
      where \(A\) is the original dimensions of a body and \(B\) is the dimensions of the body after deformation. <br>
      Strain is a dimensionless scalar quantity. <br><br>

      <strong>Stress</strong> is the <em>magnitude of the restoring force per unit area, perpendicular to the surface, aroused due to the application of an external force of equal magnitude</em>.
      \[
        \text{stress} = \frac{F}A
      \]
      where \(F\) is the magnitude of the applied or restoring force and \(A\) is the surface area perpendicular to the force. <br>
      The dimensions of stress is [ML\({}^{-1}\)T\({}^{-2}\)] and its units are Nm\({}^{-2}\) or Pa (Pascals). <br><br>
