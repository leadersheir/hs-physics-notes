      <h4>Intermolecular Forces</h4>
      The forces that act between molecules are, obviously enough, called <em>intermolecular</em> forces. They arise from
      <ol>
        <li>Potential energy from the iteraction with surrounding molecules.</li>
        <li>Thermal energy from the movement of the system of molecules. This is essentially kinetic energy.</li>
      </ol>

      Intermolecular forces between two molecules primarily depend on the distance \(r\) between them.

      <h4>Types of Bonds</h4>
      Each of the points in the uniform lattice structure which certain substances assume when forming a bond is called a <em>lattice point</em>.

      <h5>Ionic Bonds</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Each of the lattice points is occupied by an ion.</li>
        <li>Attraction arises from the electrostatic force; which being strong, also makes the bonds comparatively strong.</li>
        <li>The melting point is high due to the strength of the bonds.</li>
        <li>The electro-conductivity is low.</li>
        <li>Ionic bonds are only established between a metal and a non-metal.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Covalent Bonds</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>It's established only between non-metals by the sharing of electrons between two adjacent atoms.</li>
        <li>Highly rigid.</li>
        <li>High melting point.</li>
        <li>Low electro-conductivity.</li>
        <li>Compounds formed by covalent bonds generally act as electric dipoles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Metallic Bonds</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Established due to the presence of delocalized electrons, essentially like sharing the electrons of a metal atom with the rest of the atoms in a solid body.</li>
        <li>The lattice points have positive ions and free electrons move around the whole structure.</li>
        <li>High electro-conductivity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Vandar Waals Bond</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Arises between nonpolar molecules due to a temporary change in dipole moment.</li>
        <li>Solids formed by this bond are called <em>molecular solids</em>.</li>
        <li>Solids formed by this bond are generally soft.</li>
        <li>Low melting point and bad electro-conductivity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Definitions Regarding Elasticity</h4>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Elasticity</strong>. The property of a deformed material to regain its original length, volume, and shape, once the deforming force has been removed, is called <em>elasticity</em>. <br><br>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Perfectly Elastic Body</strong>. A deformed body that fully returns to its initial length, volume, and shape, once the deforming force has been removed, is called a <em>perfectly elastic body</em>. <br><br>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Elastic Limit</strong>. The maximum applied force up to which a body remains <em>perfectly elastic</em> is called the <em>elastic limit</em>. <br><br>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Perfectly Rigid Body</strong>. A body that cannot be deformed by applying any magnitude of external force is called a <em>perfectly rigid body</em>. Such substances are not observed in nature. <br><br>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Perfectly Plastic Body</strong>. A body that retains its deformed shape and size once the deforming force has been removed, is called a <em>perfectly plastic body</em>. <br><br>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Breaking Force</strong>. The minimum applied force for which a body breaks or snaps is called the <em>breaking force</em>. <br><br>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Breaking Stress</strong>. The minimum perpendicular force applied per unit area for which a body breaks or snaps is called the <em>breaking stress</em>. <br><br>

      <h4>Elastic Properties</h4>

      <strong>Strain</strong> is the <em>change in the dimensions per unit dimension of a body due to the application of an external force</em>. It's the rate of deformation of a body.
      \[
        \text{strain} = \frac{B \text{~} A}{A}
      \]
      where \(A\) is the original dimensions of a body and \(B\) is the dimensions of the body after deformation. <br>
      Strain is a dimensionless scalar quantity. <br><br>

      <strong>Stress</strong> is the <em>magnitude of the restoring force per unit area, perpendicular to the surface, aroused due to the application of an external force of equal magnitude</em>.
      \[
        \text{stress} = \frac{F}A
      \]
      where \(F\) is the magnitude of the applied or restoring force and \(A\) is the surface area perpendicular to the force. <br>
      The dimensions of stress is [ML\({}^{-1}\)T\({}^{-2}\)] and its units are Nm\({}^{-2}\) or Pa (Pascals). <br><br>

      The molecules in a crystal generally remain at a minimum potential energy state - the equilibrium, where the net intermolecular force is 0. <br><br>

      <strong>Longitudinal/tensile strain</strong> is the change in the length of a body per unit length.
      \[
        \text{tensile strain} = \frac{l}{l_{0}}
      \]

      The perpendicular force that arises per unit surface area to resist the tensile strain, equal to the force applied to cause the tensile strain, is called the <strong>tensile stress</strong>.
      \[
        \text{tensile stress} = \frac{F}{A}
      \]

      For a wire of radius \(r\) and cross-sectional area \(A = \pi r^2\)
      \[
        \text{tensile stress} = \frac{mg}{\pi r^2}
      \]
      where \(m\) is the mass connected at the bottom of the wire and \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity.

      Following the same reasoning as the tensile stress, the change in the volume per unit volume of a body is
      \[
        \text{volumetric/bulk strain} = \frac{V}{V_{0}}
      \]

      Consequently,
      \[
        \text{volumetric/bulk stress} = \frac{F}{A}
      \]

      <strong>Shearing strain</strong> is the relative displacement of two parallel planes situated at a unit distance.

      \[
        \text{shearing strain} = \frac{\Delta x}{x_{0}}, \quad \Delta x \equiv x - x_0
      \]

      And the strain angle
      \[
        \theta = \arctan \left( \frac{\Delta x}{x_0} \right)
      \]
      recall that the body is of unit dimensions (length and width), there \(x_0\) is also the distance between the parallel planes.

      <strong>Hook's Law</strong> states: within elastic limit, the stress of a body is directly proportional to the strain.
      \[
        \text{stress} \propto \text{strain} \iff \frac{\text{stress}}{\text{strain}} = \text{constant}
      \]

      Continuously applying and removing stress to a body causes it <em><strong>elastic fatigue</strong></em>; as a result of which its elasticity decreases and it takes logner to return to its original state once the deforming force is removed. An <em>elastically fatigued</em> body can snap at a loewr <em>breaking load</em> even within its elastic limit.

      <h4>Elastic Moduli</h4>

      <em>def</em> <strong>Elastic moduli</strong> are the ratios of stress and strain of a material, which remains constant within the elastic limit. <br><br>

      <strong>Young's modulus</strong> or longitudinal modulus is given by
      \begin{align}
        \gamma &= \frac{\text{tensile stress}}{\text{tensile strain}} \\
               &= \frac{ F/A }{ l/l_0 } \\
               &= \frac{Fl_0}{Al}
      \end{align}

      where \(F\) is the magnitude of the applied force, \(A\) is the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the force, \(l\) is the stretched or compressed length of the material, and \(l_0\) is the original length of the material. <br><br>

      For a mass \(m\) attached at the bottom end of a wire of radius \(r\) and cross-sectional area \(A = \pi r^2\)
      \[
        \gamma = \frac{mgl_0}{\pi r^2 l}
      \]

      <strong>Bulk modulus</strong> is given by
      \begin{align}
        \beta &= \frac{\text{bulk stress}}{\text{bulk strain}} \\
              &= \frac{ F/A }{ V/V_0 } \\
              &= \frac{FV_0}{AV} \\
              &= \frac{PV_0}{V}
      \end{align}

      where \(V_0\) is the original volume of the material, \(V\) is the volume of the material after deformation, and \(P\) is the pressure applied to the material, which is the bulk stress. <br><br>

      <strong>Compressibility</strong> is the ratio of the <em>bulk strain</em> to the <em>bulk stress</em> on a material within the elastic limit. It's the reciprocal of the bulk modulus.
      \[
        \text{compressibility} = \frac{\text{bulk strain}}{\text{bulk stress}} = \frac{1}\beta
      \]

      The <strong>rigidity modulus</strong> or <strong>shear modulus</strong> is given by
      \begin{align}
        G &= \frac{\text{shearing stress}}{\text{shearing strain}} \\
          &= \frac{F/A}{x/x_0} \\
          &= \frac{F/A}{\tan\theta}
      \end{align}
      
      where \(\theta\) is the strain angle. <br>

      For \(\theta \lt\lt 1\), \(\tan\theta \approx \theta\)
      \[
        \therefore G = \frac{F}{A\theta}
      \]

      [Shear/rigidity modulus is denoted by an \(n\) in Dr. Tapan's text.] <br><br>

      Within elastic limit, the ratio of the lateral strain to the longitudinal strain is constant, and is termed as the <strong>poisson ratio</strong>.
      \[
        \sigma = \frac{\text{lateral strain}}{longitudinal strain}
      \]

      For a wire of diameter \(d_0\) and and length \(l_0\)
      \[
        \text{lateral strain} = \frac{d}{d_0}
      \]
      \[
        \text{longitudinal strain} = \frac{l}{l_0}
      \]
      
      Therefore the poisson's ratio is given by
      \begin{align}
        \sigma &= \frac{d/d_0}{l/l_0} \\
               &= \frac{dl_0}{d_0l} \\
      \end{align}

      An equivalent but slightly different expression for the poisson's ratio is
      \[
        \sigma = -\frac{rl_0}{lr_0}
      \]
      where \(r\) is the change in the radius of the wire due to deformation, and \(r_0\) is the original radius of the wire. The negative sign signifies that
      \begin{align}
        l \gt 0 &\implies r \lt 0, \quad \text{and} \\
        l \lt 0 &\implies r \gt 0
      \end{align}

      The poisson's ratio, being a ratio of two strains, is a dimensionless quantity. <br><br>

      In theory, sigma (poisson's ratio) remains within the range \(-1 \leq \sigma \leq 0.5\); but the negative value of \(\sigma\) is interpreted as the expansion of the diameter due to the expansion of the length (or vice versa), which is not observed in nature. <br><br>

      Generally, for metals
      \[
        0 \leq \sigma \leq 0.5
      \]

      The work done to deform a body longitudinally is given by
      \[
        W = \int_0^l \frac{\gamma A}L \, dl = \frac{1}2 \frac{\gamma A l^2}L
      \]
      
      where \(\gamma\) is the young's modulus, \(A\) is the cross-sectional area, and \(L\) is the initial length of the material. <br><br>

      <h4>Fluids</h4>

      The type of fluid flow in which all particles follow the path of the adjacent particles moving forward with roughly the same velocity is called <strong>streamline flow</strong>. <br>
      In a streamline flow, the velocity of the flow is lower than the critical velocity of the fluid. <br><br>

      The type of fluid flow where the particles are flowing at a greater velocity than the critical velocity of the fluid is called <strong>turbulent flow</strong>. <br><br>

      <strong>Osborne Reynolds</strong> proved that the critical velocity of a fluid depends on the <em>coefficient of viscocity</em> (\(eta\)) of the fluid, the density (\(\rho\)) of the fluid, and the radius (\(r\)) of the tube which the fluid is flowing through.
      \[
        v_c \propto \frac{\eta}{\rho r}
      \]

      The proportionality constant is the <em>Reynold's number</em> \(R_e\).
      \[
        v_c = R_e \frac{\eta}{\rho r}
      \]

      The type of fluid flow relates to the Reynold's number in the following ways
      \begin{align}
        R_e &\lt 2000  \implies \text{streamline flow} \\
        R_e &\leq 3000 \implies \text{transitioning from streamline to turbulent flow} \\
        R_e &> 3000 \implies \text{turbulent flow}
      \end{align}

      The property of a fluid to resist the relative motion of the different layers of it is termed as <strong>viscocity</strong> or <strong>internal friction</strong>. <br><br>

      Taking two layers of a fluid \(dy\) away from each other with velocities \(v\) and \(dv\), the <strong>velocity gradient</strong> is
      \[
        \frac{dv}{dy}
      \]

      Newton's law of viscocity states - if there is relative velocity between two layers of a fluid at constant temperature, then the tangential viscous force is directly proportional to the surface area and the velocity gradient of the layers.
      \begin{align}
        F \propto A, \quad \frac{dv}{dy} \text{ constant} \\
        F \propto \frac{dv}{dy}, \quad A \text{ constant} \\
        F \propto A \frac{dv}{dy}, \quad \text{ none are constant}
      \end{align}

      And the proportionality constant is the coefficient of viscocity.
      \[
        F = \eta A \frac{dv}{dy}
      \]
      
      The dimensions of the viscous force is [ML\({}^{-1}\)T\({}^{-1}\)], and its units are Nsm\({}^{-2}\) or Pa\(\cdot\)s. <br><br>

      Another unit for the viscous force is <em>poise</em>.
      \[
        1 \text{ Nsm}^{-2} = 10 \text{ poise}
      \]

      The relation between the viscocity of a liquid with temperature is given by
      \[
        \log \eta = A + \frac{B}T
      \]
      
      where \(A\) and \(B\) are constants. <br><br>

      The viscocity of gases is directly proportional to the square root of the temperature.
      \[
        \eta \propto \sqrt{T}
      \]

      The relation between temperature and viscocity in liquids
      \[
        T \uparrow \implies V \downarrow, \quad T \downarrow \implies V \uparrow
      \]

      And in gases
      \[
        T \uparrow \implies V \uparrow, \quad T \downarrow \implies V \downarrow
      \]

      Pressure increases the viscocity in liquids, but almost no change in viscocity is observed in gases due to a change in pressure. However, some exceptions do occur at low pressures.

      <h4>Stokes' Law and Drag Forces in Liquids</h4>

      <strong>Stokes' Law</strong> states: the resistive force of a fluid on a sphere traversing through it is directly proportional to the radius of the sphere, the velocity of the sphere, and the viscocity of the fluid.
      \[
        F = 6 \pi \eta r v
      \]
      where \(F\) is the resistive force, \(\eta\) is the coefficient of viscocity of the fluid, \(r\) is the radius of the sphere, and \(v\) is the velocity of the sphere. <br><br>

      The maximum constant velocity at which a body can travel in a fluid is called the <strong>terminal velocity</strong>. It's obtained when the applied force equals te resistive viscous force. <br><br>

      The terminal velocity of a solid sphere falling in a fluid is given by
      \[
        v_{\text{terminal}} = \frac{2r^2(\rho_s - \rho_f)g}{9\eta}
      \]
      where \(\rho_s\) is the density of the sphere, \(\rho_f\) is the density of the fluid, \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \(\eta\) is the coefficient of viscocity. <br><br>

      For air bubbles coming up in a fluid
      \[
        v_{\text{terminal}} = \frac{2r^2(\rho_f - \rho_s)g}{9\eta}
      \]
      but since \(\rho_s \lt\lt \rho_f\),
      \[
        v_{\text{terminal}} = \frac{2r^2\rho_f g}{9\eta}
      \]
